# Travel4Future
### HackUPC Project
## By travellers, for travellers and a healthier planet.
The first sustainable travel platform devoted to raise awareness of people's impact on the world in an original and friendly way.
### Description
The website is designed to suggest you the "greenest" path between two places, but still realistical enough to be a feasible itinerary. The modes of transportation vary from flights, rails and public transport. 
Furthermore, in the design are included small tips and tricks to apply in your daily life to become a more conscious and responsible decision-maker.
### Frameworks
The project has been developed using Django Framework and Vue.js, using SkyScanner API and Google Maps Direction API.
